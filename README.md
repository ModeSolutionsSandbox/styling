## How to Use These Guides
1. Fork one of the provided guides that is closest your the desired theme. However, given that you will be updating the rules as little or as much as you desire, the guides are to just provide the CSS Selectors found in most Mode reports. 
2. Using your knowledge of CSS and HTML update the attributes of the desired selectors. _(You can add custom selectors and use the HTML editor of the report that wish to apply the custom selectors rules)_
3. When completed, navigate to the Mode home page, click on your name in the upper left corner of the screen and click **Workspace Settings** > **Color & Themes** > Select the **Themes** tab at the top.

You can either:

 - Copy and Paste the CSS syntax into the provided field, or 
 - Use an @import statement to import the rules. 
<br>
Note: While you cannot include any JavaScript in a custom theme, you can embed JavaScript in reports directly using the HTML Editor.
